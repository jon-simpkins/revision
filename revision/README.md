# Revision (the [Flutter](https://flutter.dev) version)

We're currently migrating to a [Flutter](https://flutter.dev) version of the application.

When this migration is complete, you'll need the following to develop:
* [Protocol Buffer](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/downloads) CLI tools
* [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) SDK

A nice TODO will be to Dockerize all these, to reduce the dev setup time.
