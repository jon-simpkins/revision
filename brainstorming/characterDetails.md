# Characters

The point of this document is just a scratchpad to track thoughts on what we would want to keep track of for characters.

## Name

People need names, it's allowed to be a cool pseudonym like "The Man in Black" or "Q", but it's how they're referred to in the script when the audience is supposed to know who they are.

## Types

I'm thinking that there are a few types of characters:

### Main

A main character has a name that another person might call them, would probably appear on the poster,
could have a backstory and/or an archetype, and they have a clearly defined motivations which can change over the course of the story. They have interesting relationships with other characters, and those relationships may change over the course of the story.

In Die Hard, this is John, Hans, Holly, Al.

### Secondary

A main character has a name that another person might call them, would probably not appear on the poster, but would likely briefly appear in the trailer.

They might exist just to serve the theme or the plot, and as such they might be more likely to fit a stock character mold than have an interesting backstory.

Their relationships with other characters are more likely to be static, as are their motivations.

In Die Hard, this is Harry, Carl, Argyle.

### Tertiary

A tertiary charcter probably is "named" by their role (Doctor 1, FBI Agent 3), won't probably have a backstory, and their relationships and motivations are likely only based on their role ("Waiter" pours coffee, "Taxi Driver" drives, "Invading Alien #3" shoots a ray gun).

In Die Hard, this is Guard #1, Hostage #2, FBI Agent Johnson and FBI Agent Johsnon.

## Thoughts from my 6 year old on "what would be important about a character?"

What they like, and don't like, what they're afraid of.

What their name is

Where they live

Which pages of the story they're in
