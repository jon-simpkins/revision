# V3 (New Approach)

Alright, so v1-v2 were based on collaboration, and using Google Docs as the backend storage for the content.

Instead, for v3 we're going to start off focusing on a very browser-centric approach. PWA support from the beginning,
storing all data in local storage / IndexdDb, and allowing export / import but focusing primarily on the in-browser
single user experience.
