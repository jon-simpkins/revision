# Data Management

Well, I seem to have written myself into a corner a bit with the 'scrap' approach,
where every edit is a self-contained change to some element of the story and where
the story can be stitched together from these changes.

Here's why: sometimes, to make a minor, focused change in one scrap, you need to
make a complementary tweak to another scrap elsewhere. If I write a summary of a
section of the movie and reference a new character, it feels cumbersome to then
have to go *create* that character in a distinct followup scrap, then revise the
summary in a third scrap to reference that newly created character.

It seems like the best way to do this would be to simply have the story in its
entirety be available to every edit, and to record the delta of the change (delta from before to after the edit)
when saving the story.
